nsindex Plugin for DokuWiki

Creates an dynamic list of namespace pages/subns to be used inside a page

Syntax: '{{nsindex' [' ' OPTION ','..] '}}'
 OPTIONs may be:
  'nopages' => only show namespace links, no pages.
  'nons'    => only show pages in current namespace, nu sub-namespaces.
  'nogroup' => do not group list by their first letters
 TODO:
  'titlesort'
  'namesort'
  'numlist'
  'nonumlist'
  'notemplate' => alias for 'hide:template'
  'hide:<PAGENAME>'

 NOTES:
  - The 'start'-page of the current namespace is omitted from the list
  - Pages using this plugin are not cached at all (no '~~NOCACHE~~' needed)
